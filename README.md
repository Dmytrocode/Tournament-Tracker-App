# Tournament Tracker Application

This is an outgoing project about a Tournament Tracker Application created with C# and the .NET Framework.



The application is connected with a SQL database which will send and retrieve information from.



For this project, I am following the steps of Tim Corey (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-ptWR16ITQyYOglXyQmpzw),

This is a complex real-world application, so please do not expect me to know everything at the detail. I am currently learning endless
programming skills and knowdledge by learning from Tim Corey.

The goal is to add my own modifications to the application after it is completed.
