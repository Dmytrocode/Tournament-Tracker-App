This is a complex real-world application, so please do not expect me to know everything at the detail. I am currently learning endless
programming skills and knowdledge by learning from Tim Corey.

The goal is to gain understanding of how .NET applications works, and use the knowledge for future projects or contributions. 

For this project, I am following Tim Corey's Course (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-ptWR16ITQyYOglXyQmpzw),
